# Phase 1 - Leave your Fathers House & Go

> 1 Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
>
> 2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
>
> 3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
>
> 4 So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
>
> Genesis 12:1-4 KJV

As we start this journey towards Biblical Manhood I begin by looking at someone else in the Bible who began a tremendous journey that lasted several years and which led him out of his home city on a journey to a land that was as wild as the "Wild West" which God promised he would ultimately give to his descendants as their inheritance - of course we are talking about Abraham here!

What is interesting is that when God speaks to Abraham he tells him to leave his country, family and father's house and go to a land which he will show him. If we want to truly become Biblical men we need to often leave (lay aside) our cultural and familial ties and activities to go to a new land (embrace a new culture, way of life etc.) that God has for us.

Often we can be the slaves of our own culture or family constantly running from one event to another or running one errand after another for our families, trying to do "the right thing". We are so busy caught up in this rat wheel that we don't have the mind space to hear what God is saying to us or the time to do what he wants us to do.

God often leads us into a wilderness when He calls us so we can hear him and be free of all the old things that entangle us.

These things can also be a negative friendship circle or activities and places that lead us into sin. We need to be free of it all so we can build a life anew with God.

## Uprooting and Clearing
In order to get free we need to think about out lives as if it was an overgrown garden that needed remodelling. Before you can re-model an overgrown garden you often need to uproot and clear many trees, bushes, moss etc. that don't fit with the new plan or perhaps they need to be moved somewhere else, but essentially the core starting point is uprooting and clearing.

There are certain thinghs we should look for in our lives that we should mark as needing to be uprooted or cleared.
They include:
* Things or relationships that we draw our self worth or value from outside of Jesus.
* Things or relationships that you are obsessed with, that take up your mind space, or constantly demand your loyalty outside of Jesus.

If it is a huge struggle to break some of these bonds I recommend leaving where you live and ask God to show you a new City or Town to live in or perhaps a new Nation!

I have created a starter list below of some basic things that you should deal with. The reality is that each person has their own set of things which are "junk" in their lives that they need to clear out. If you allow yourself a moment of stillness the Holy Spirit will show you, or your consicense, the things you need to throw out.

## Uproot List
### Activities
* TV / Series / Youtube
* Movies with junk in them
  * Horror / Drama
  * Porn, Sex Scenes etc.
* Staying up after 11PM at night  
* Sleeping more than 8 Hours a day
* Alcohol
* Excessive Partying / Clubbing etc.
  * In fact for now just stop all of it
  * Ditch the associated "friends"...
  * As I said we will replace this all later
* Hanging out with friends who encourage you to do the stupid stuff on this list
* Video / PC / Role Playing Games
  * Just sell it all on Ebay (includes board games that aren't social - i.e. board games that girls don't like playing)
* Binge eating
* Pictures, videos etc. of old girlfriends
* Remove things that link you to relationships, religious practices etc. that are destructive

### Food
* Sugar
* Food with gluten in it
* Refined wheat products
* Any processed products
  * Just stop going to Burger King, Mc Donalds etc.
* There is more here, but we will get to that later...
### Poisonous Relationships or committments in your...
* Family

* Business
* Community or Nation

## In Closing
Take some time to write up a list of things that need to change. Certain thnigs you can deal with immediately like TV watching etc. Other things you may need to develop a plan or discipline to stop doing it. Regarding relationships you need to take the time to talk through the changes with your family, friends etc. Be gentle even if the response you get is not.

In a future installment we will talk about starting to use this freed up time to build up some Godly patterns and disciplines in our lives.
