We live in a day age where men no longer understand what it is to be a man. The media has been this generations poor tutor in this regard and has left us impoverished, confused and none the wiser as to what it is to be a man

The concept of manhood is facing an incredible onslaught from the enemy in this day and age. The very concept of what it is to be a man and also a woman is slowly but surely being removed from western society as we speak. We are in a season where we need to take a stand to reclaim biblical manhood from the gutters where it has been thrown.

In this book I want to take you on a journey to help you rediscover your identity as a man and what God had intended for you to be.
