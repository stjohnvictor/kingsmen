# Introduction
> Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.
> 1 Corinthians 16:13 ESV

The concept of manhood is facing an incredible onslaught from the enemy in this day and age. The very concept of what it is to be a man and also a woman is slowly but surely being removed from western society as we speak. We are in a season where we need to take a stand to reclaim biblical manhood from the gutters where it has been thrown.

In this book I want to take you on a journey to help you rediscover your identity as a man and what God had intended for you to be.
