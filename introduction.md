## Who is this book for?
* Christian teenagers and young men in their 20's and 30's in Germany and the Western World (English)

## Why?
We live in a day age where men no longer understand what it is to be a man. The media has been this generations poor tutor and has left us confused about manhood and as blind men following the blind. Many of us boys have a deep need to be initiated into manhood, but we don't see any role models we can follow in the world or the church. We read this incredible mandate Jesus has give his people to disciple the Nations, but we can't even tie our own shoe laces. We feel pretty useless and the world thinks we are a joke as a generation already (millenials).

This is our journey to explore how Jesus defines manhood; how he lived it out so that we can follow suit. I don't want to limit the Trinity to the typical Sunday School lessons about manhood. His ways of teaching often come in difficult packages, but in forms we need like a Drill Sergeant to get us into shape.

## How?
> 20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;
> Proverbs 1:20 ESV
By positioning our selves to hear. This starts with a heart decision to want to learn. This is actually a form of repentance acknowledging that we have not listened to the Trinity as they have tried to teach us their ways. One of the most powerful prayers we can pray is for us to ask God to forgive us for not listening to, honouring and learning from our parents in particular out Fathers. But also other people who are leaders in our lives, e.g. Bosses, Teachers, Government Authorities etc.

As we repent we position ourselves to hear. The Trinity is constantly trying to teach us to and train us into maturity, if we position ourselves to listen (be teachable) and then act on what we hear we we can grow.

The concept of manhood is facing an incredible onslaught from the enemy in this day and age. The very concept of what it is to be a man and also a woman is slowly but surely being removed from western society as we speak. We are in a season where we need to take a stand to reclaim biblical manhood from the gutters where it has been thrown.

In this book I want to take you on a journey to help you rediscover your identity as a man and what God had intended for you to be.
