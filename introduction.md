## Who is this book for?
* Christian teenagers and young men in their 20's and 30's in Germany and the Western World (English)

## Why?
We live in a day age where men no longer understand what it is to be a man. The media has been this generations poor tutor and has left us confused about manhood and as blind men following the blind. Many of us boys have a deep need to be initiated into manhood, but we don't see any role models we can follow in the world or the church. We read this incredible mandate Jesus has give his people to disciple the Nations, but we can't even tie our own shoe laces. We feel pretty useless and the world thinks we are a joke as a generation already (millenials).

This is our journey to discover what it is to be a kingdom man, growing more and more like Jesus each day



The concept of manhood is facing an incredible onslaught from the enemy in this day and age. The very concept of what it is to be a man and also a woman is slowly but surely being removed from western society as we speak. We are in a season where we need to take a stand to reclaim biblical manhood from the gutters where it has been thrown.

In this book I want to take you on a journey to help you rediscover your identity as a man and what God had intended for you to be.
