# UpRoot
* Your life can be alikened to a garden
  * If your life is like a jungle we need to uproot a lot before we can replant and maintain a healthy garden
* What follows is a long list of things you just need to stop doing
* Step by step we will begin to add new disciplines to replace all the junk

## Uproot List
### Activities
* Staying up after 11PM at night
* Movies with junk in them
  * Horror / Drama
  * Porn, Sex Scenes etc.
* Sleeping more than 8 Hours a day
* Alcohol
* Excessive Partying / Clubbing etc.
  * In fact for now just stop all of it
  * Ditch the associated "friends"...
  * As I said we will replace this all later
* Hanging out with friends who encourage you to do the stupid stuff on this list
* Video / PC / Role Playing Games
  * Just sell it all on Ebay (includes board games that aren't social - i.e. board games that girls don't like playing)
* Binge eating
### Food
* Sugar
* Refined wheat products
* There is more here, but we will get to that later...
